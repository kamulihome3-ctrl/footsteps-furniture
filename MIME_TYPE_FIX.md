# MIME Type Error Fix Guide

## Problem
"Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'application/octet-stream'"

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated .htaccess (Apache Servers)
- Added explicit MIME type declarations for JavaScript files
- Fixed module script serving issues
- Added security headers

### 2. Created web.config (IIS/Windows Servers)
- Configured proper MIME types for IIS servers
- Added URL rewriting for React Router
- Security headers included

### 3. Updated Vite Build Configuration
- Forced ES module format output
- Explicit file naming for better server recognition
- Added development server headers

## Deployment Instructions

### For Apache Hosting:
1. Upload the updated `.htaccess` file to your domain root
2. Ensure it's in the same directory as your built files

### For Windows/IIS Hosting:
1. Upload the `web.config` file to your domain root
2. This handles MIME types automatically

### For Any Hosting Provider:
If issues persist, contact your hosting provider and request:
- Enable proper MIME type for `.js` files as `application/javascript`
- Enable module script support
- Ensure ES6 module support

## Testing
After deployment:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Verify Network tab shows correct MIME types
4. All JavaScript files should load as `application/javascript`

## Alternative Solutions
If hosting doesn't support proper MIME types:
1. Use Netlify (automatic MIME type handling)
2. Use Vercel (built-in support)
3. Use GitHub Pages with Actions
4. Switch to a modern hosting provider

Your Footsteps Furniture application is now configured to handle MIME type issues across different hosting environments.
